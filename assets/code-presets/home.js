// This is what the editors you'll be using will look like.
// This green text is a comment. Whatever you put after two slashes doesn't affect the code, and is called a "comment".
// Programmers usually leave comments for anyone else who looks at the code, so they know what it does.

// Here is some sample code. It doesn't matter if you don't understand what it does,
// it's just here for show. You can come back every lesson and see how much more you understand!

// Make a variable called "condition" and set it to true
var condition = true;
// If the variable "condition" is true, print "Hello World!" to the console
if (condition) {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}

// Create an array with some diffent fruits
var array = ["apple", "orange", "pear", "grape", "peach", "bannana"];
// Print a random fruit from the array
console.log(array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)]);
