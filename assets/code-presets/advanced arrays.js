// Now it's your turn. Try to create a 2D array with 25 columns and 10 rows, and explore it in the console.
// 2D arrays look strange in the console, because everything is displayed vertically.
// They will act correctly in the code, though.

var array = [];
// Put your code here

// Print array to console
console.log(array);
