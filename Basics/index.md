The most basic rule of coding is that every statement has to have a semicolon after it.\
This tells the computer that you're done with the current statement, so it can execute it and be ready for the next one.\
Also, if you put two slashes at the beginning of a line (`//`), that line becomes a comment.\
It won't affect the code. Comments are usually left to tell others how a specific piece of code works, or what it does.\
\
The next step of learning Javascript is variables.\
Variables are used to save data, so you don't need to retype a specific number every time you need to use it.\
For example, let's say I wanted to save an age for later, how about `23`?\
Then I would simply type `var age = 23;`.\
`var` tells the computer you're aboout to define a variable, `age` tell the computer it's going to be called "age", and `= 23` tells the computer to set it to 23.\
Finally, the `;` tells the computer you're done defining the variable, so it's ready for the next statement.
\
You can save more than just numbers, you can also save text in a variable by surrounding it with quotes (`"`).\
For example: `var age = "Twenty Three";`\
Text variables are called "strings".\
