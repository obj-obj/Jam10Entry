title: A Simple Coding Tutorial

My entry for the [Repl.it Code Jam #10](https://repl.it/talk/announcements/Code-Jam-10/78974).

<br/><br/>

This is my simple coding tutorial, which will guide you through different parts of Javascript.\
Eventually, you will put all these lessons together and make a Snake game.

###### How to use

1. Open your browser's console:
    1. `CTRL + SHIFT + K` for Firefox,
    2. `CTRL + SHIFT + J` for Edge/Chrome,
    3. and `F12` for other browsers.
2. Click the "Run" button below. You should see some output in the console, and a snake game should pop up.
3. Click the nav button in the top-right to view all the tutorial pages. You can also try editing the code below, if you want.
