title: A Simple Coding Tutorial

My entry for the [Repl.it Code Jam #10](https://repl.it/talk/announcements/Code-Jam-10/78974).

<br/><br/>

This is my simple coding tutorial, which will guide you through the basics of Javascript, have you create small snippets of code, and then put it all together into a program.\
